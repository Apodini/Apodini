/// A `ConnectionEffect` describes the affect of a `Response` on a connection.
/// This impacts stream connection types such as client, service or bidirectional streams
///
///
/// These values should not be directly set by an Apodini developer.
/// Use the possible `Response` static computed properties or functions to create a `Response`
enum ConnectionEffect {
    /// The connection should stay open
    case open
    /// The connection should be closed
    case close
}
