# Apodini Documentation

* The [communication patterns](./Communicational%20Patterns/) folder contains general information about different communicational patterns that can be used to implement a web service using Apodini.  
* The [property wrapper](./PropertyWrapper/) folder details information about the different property wrappers that can be used to describe the web service API.  
* Modifiers that can be applied to `Component`s and `Handler`s are described in the [modifiers](./Modifiers/) folder.  
* Any additional functionality such as `Jobs` provided by Apodini is described in the [additional functionality](./AdditionalFunctionality/) folder.

## Labeling

We use a labeling-system for the Documentation folder, where every file/headline should be marked with one of the following labels:

![proposal](https://apodini.github.io/resources/markdown-labels/document_type_proposal.svg)  
A proposal is a suggestion on the future development of Apodini. It can be written in the style of any of the following labels and offers a basis for discussion that can be refined into concepts, documentation, or visions.

PRs containing changes on content marked with one of the following labels should only be merged into develop once approved by the community:

![concept](https://apodini.github.io/resources/markdown-labels/document_type_concept.svg)  
A concept is a document that contains little to no implementational-detail but focuses on core principles instead.

![documentation](https://apodini.github.io/resources/markdown-labels/document_type_documentation.svg)  
A documentation is a document that describes Apodini in its current state and goes into technical detail. 

![vision](https://apodini.github.io/resources/markdown-labels/document_type_vision.svg)  
A vision is a document that describes how Apodini is supposed to look like in the future and goes into technical detail.
