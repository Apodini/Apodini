# Environment

The `@Environment` property wrapper provides different functionality depending on the `wrappedValue`. For more detail on how the `wrappedValue` is provided to the environment and what values are provided by the Apodini framework refer to [PropertyWrapper -> RequestAndEnvironment](../../PropertyWrapper/RequestAndEnvironment.md).

## ObservableObject

If the `wrappedValue` conforms to `ObservableObject`, the `@Environment` behaves exactly the same as [`@ObservedObject`](./2.4.%20ObservedObject.md).

In any other case `@Environment` has no influence on the `Handler`'s lifetime or control flow.

## Connection

Apodini provides a `Connection` through the environment. This object can be accessed using `@Environment(\.connection)`. The `Connection` provides useful protocol-agnostic information about the current state of the communication. The `Connection` could provide a `start: Date` so the service could e.g. close connections with an timeout error.

The most important property of `Connection` is `state: ConnectionState`. This state can be `.open` or `.end`, where `.end` signalizes that the protocol expects the connection to be closed now. The `Handler` will be destructed after the next evaluation that results in a `.send(Request)`. Usage of this special environment object may cause exporters to utilize a client-side stream for implementation of the respective endpoint.
