# ObservedObject

The `@ObservedObject` wraps an `ObservableObject`. An `ObservableObject` may have multiple `@Published` properties. Each `@Published` property is projected to a `Publisher`. A `Handler` that contains an `@ObservedObject` subscribes to these `Publisher`s and evaluates the `Handler` on each update.

## Lifetime

The lifetime of the `ObservedObject` itself depends on the way it is created. The developer could pass it in from the outside (e.g. from a lower `Component`) as sort of a singleton which lives until the process dies. If the `ObservedObject` is created inside the `Handler` it is recreated every time a new connection is established but lives for the complete lifetime of the `Handler`.

`ObservedObject`s can be globally declared by defining them in the `configuration` computed property of the web service using `Environment(keypath, value)`. This `Configuration` takes as arguments a keypath that is used to retrieve the `ObservableObject` from a property wrapper `@ObservedObject(\.keypath)` and the corresponding value that should be injected. Locally defined `ObservableObject`s don't require the use of a keypath.

Example configuration of a global `ObservableObject`:

```swift
struct Bird: ObservableObject {
    var name: String
    var age: Int
}

struct BirdHandler: Handler {
    @Environment(\.bird) var bird: Bird

    // ...
}

var configuration: Configuration {
    Environment(\.bird, Bird())
}
```

### Differentiate ObservableObjects

The property wrapper `@ObservedObject` provides a projected Boolean value `changed` that can be accessed by the `$` prefix with an `ObservableObject`: `$observableObject.changed`. This value will evaluate to `true` if the corresponding `ObservableObject` caused the execution of the `Handler`. In every other case, `changed` will evaluate to `false`.

### Influence

The presence of `@ObservedObject` properties on a `Handler` signalizes exporting the endpoint as a Server-Side Stream makes sense. If the exporter decides to do so the lifetime of the `Handler` has to be extended accordingly. The `Handler` should stay alive until all `.end` or `.final(Response)` was returned.

### Implementation-Details

#### Request-Response

Exporters that only support the Request-Response pattern cannot handle multiple service-messages. The default behavior would be to return the first non-`.nothing` `Action` as the response and destruct the `Handler` afterwards.

An advanced feature would be to allow for the developer to customize the strategy used for a certain endpoint, e.g. using `.downgrade(using strategy: Strategy)` on the according `Component`. `Strategy` could be the default `.cutOff` or `.collect`. The latter would result in the exported response-type to be `[Response]` and the `Handler` collecting all `.send(Response)` actions until the `Handler` is destructed when `.end` or `.final(Response)` is returned.

#### Client-Side Stream

Refer to Request-Response.

#### Service-Side Stream

The Service-Side Stream can fully support the features provided by `@ObservedObject`. The `Handler` stays alive until either `.end` or `.final(Response)` is returned.

#### Bidirectional Stream

Refer to Service-Side Stream.

## Control Flow

### Influence

`@ObservableObject`s emit events if one of their `wrappedProperty`'s `@Published` emits an event. The `Handler` is evaluated for each `receive(_:)` or `receive(completion:)` called by one of the `@Published`s.

### Implementation Details

Each exporter must subscribe to `@ObervedObject`s, no matter what communicational patterns it supports. Even for a request-response pattern the initial request providing `@Parameter`s could result in an `Action.nothing` being returned. In that case the required non-`.nothing` `Action` will result from an event that comes from one of the `@ObservedObject`s.
