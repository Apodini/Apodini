# ObservedObject

The `@ObservedObject` wraps an `ObservableObject`. An `ObservableObject` may have multiple `@Published` properties. Each `@Published` property is projected to a `Publisher`. A `Handler` that contains an `@ObservedObject` subscribes to these `Publisher`s and evaluates the `Handler` on each update.

## Lifetime

### Influence

The presence of `@ObservedObject` properties on a `Handler` signalizes exporting the endpoint as a Server-Side Stream makes sense. If the exporter decides to do so the lifetime of the `Handler` has to be extended accordingly. The `Handler` should stay alive until all `Publisher`s projected from observed properties have finished.

An exception is made for `@Published(.weak)`. `Handler`s do not wait for weakly published properties to finish before being destructed.

### Implementation-Details

#### Request-Response

Exporters that only support the Request-Response pattern cannot handle multiple service-messages. The default behavior would be to return the first `.send(Response)` `Action` as the response and destruct the `Handler` afterwards.

An advanced feature would be to allow for the developer to customize the strategy used for a certain endpoint, e.g. using `.downgrade(using strategy: Strategy)` on the according `Component`. `Strategy` could be the default `.cutOff` or `.collect`. The latter would result in the exported response-type to be `[Response]` and the `Handler` collecting all `.send(Response)` actions until the `Handler` is destructed by the usual criteria of all (non-`.weak`) `@Published`s having finished.

#### Client-Side Stream

Refer to Request-Response.

#### Service-Side Stream

The Service-Side Stream can fully support the features provided by `@ObservedObject`. The `Handler` stays alive until either it is destructed because all (non-`.weak`) `@Publsihed`s have completed or the client disconnects from the stream.

#### Bidirectional Stream

Refer to Service-Side Stream.

## Control Flow

### Influence

`@ObservableObject`s emit events if one of their `wrappedProperty`'s `@Published` emits an event. The `Handler` is evaluated for each `receive(_:)` or `receive(completion:)` called by one of the `@Published`s.

### Implementation Details

Each exporter must subscribe to `@ObervedObject`s, no matter what communicational patterns it supports. Even for a request-response pattern the initial request providing `@Parameter`s could result in an `Action.nothing` being returned. In that case the required `.send(Response)` will result from an event that comes form one of the `@ObservedObject`s.
