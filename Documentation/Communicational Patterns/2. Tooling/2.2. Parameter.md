# Parameter

The property wrapper `@Parameter` is the central interface for the developer to specify what input is required for their endpoint. `@Parameter` properties are injected with a value when a message from the client arrives and before a `Handler` is evaluated. The `@Parameter`'s `wrappedValue` has no setter.

## Input-Type Derivation

If a `Handler` evaluates to another `Handler` conditionally, the child-`Handler`'s `@Parameter`s are exported as optional parameters.
If the user does provide an invalid set of parameter, Apodini responds with an according error message.

In the following example the parameter `formal` would be exported as required, while `surname` and `firstName` are optional. If one send a request providing only `formal`, or `formal = true` and `surname = "Skywalker"`, the request would result in an error.

```swift

struct FormalGreeter: Handler {
    @Parameter var surname: String

    func handle() -> String {
        "Hello Mr./Mrs. \(surname)"
    }
}

struct InformalGreeter: Handler {
    @Parameter var firstName: String

    func handle() -> String {
        "Hi \(firstName)"
    }
}

struct Greeter: Handler {
    @Parameter var formal: Bool

    var handler: Handler<String> {
        if formal {
            FormalGreeter()
        } else {
            InformalGreeter()
        }
    }
}

```


For information on how a specific exporter represents an `@Parameter` in its respective protocol and how this can be customized, refer to [PropertyWrapper -> Parameter](../../PropertyWrapper/Parameter.md).


## Lifetime

### Influence

The presence of `@Parameter` properties on a `Handler` has no influence on the `Handler`'s lifetime, i.e. how long it is kept in memory after it has been initially accessed.

### Implementation-Details

If the exporter allows for multiple messages to arrive on one instance of this endpoint (connection), then subsequent messages may override the values held in `@Parameter` properties. The contents of an `@Parameter` may never be reset (except for when the `Handler` is destructed). In case the evaluation of a `Handler` is triggered by another event than an incoming message, the `@Parameter` still holds the latest injected value.

## Control Flow

### Influence

`@Parameter`s do not emit their own events. The Apodini framework makes sure the arrival of a new incoming message is treated as an atomic event. That is:

1. `Handler`s are not evaluated once for each `@Parameter` that is injected with a value, but once for each incoming message.
2. Other events causing the `Handler` to be evaluated cannot be processed in parallel.
3. A `DynamicProperty`'s `wrappedValue` cannot change while a `Handler` is evaluated except by the `Handler`'s `handle` function.

### Implementation Details

#### Request-Response

Once a request arrives for an endpoint, all `@Parameter`s living on the initial `Handler` are injected using the exporter's decoder. Afterwards the `Handler` is evaluated. If the `Handler` evaluates to another `Handler`, the process is recursively repeated with the child-`Handler` until the `Handler` evaluates to a `handle()` function. Then this `handle()` function is executed and the `Handler` is destructed.

#### Client-Side Stream

Once a request arrives for an endpoint, all `@Parameter`s living on the initial `Handler` are injected using the exporter's decoder. Afterwards the `Handler` is evaluated. If the `Handler` evaluates to another `Handler`, the process is recursively repeated with the child-`Handler` until the `Handler` evaluates to a `handle()` function. Then this `handle()` function is executed. This process is repeated for every incoming message until the `Handler` is destructed.

Once a value was injected into an `@Parameter` it is never deleted. However, the exporter can allow subsequent messages to overwrite an `@Parameter`.

#### Service-Side Stream

Refer to the Request-Response pattern.

#### Bidirectional Stream

Refer to the Client-Side Stream pattern.
